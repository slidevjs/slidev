# Multiple Entries

You can split your slides.md into multiple files and organize them as you want using the `src` attribute.

#### `slides.md`

```markdown
# Page 1

Page 2 from main entry.

---

## src: ./subpage.md
```

<br>

#### `subpage.md`

```markdown
# Page 2

Page 2 from another file.
```
