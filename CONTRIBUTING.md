# Contributing

Excited to hear that you are interested in contributing to this project! Thanks!

## Setup

This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) to manage the dependencies, install it if you haven't via

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Clone this repo to your local machine and install the dependencies. 

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development 

To build all the packages at once, run the following command on the project root

```bash
pnpm build
```

Build with watch mode

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Run Demo

To run Slidev locally, you can run

```bash
pnpm demo:dev
```

Or with the starter template

```bash
pnpm demo:starter
```

The server will restart automatically every time the builds get updated.

## Project Structure

### Monorepo

We use monorepo to manage multiple packages

```
docs/              - The documentation site powered by VitePress
  .vitepress/      - VitePress related configurations
assets/            - Static assets will be hosted under https://sli.dev/*

packages
  slidev/          - main package entry, holds the code on Node.js side
  client/          - main frontend app
  parser/          - parser for Slidev's extended Markdown format
  create-app/      - scripts and template for `npm init slidev`
  create-theme/    - scripts and template for `npm init slidev-theme`
  theme-*/         - official themes
```

## Code Style

Don't worry about the code style as long as you install the dev dependencies. Git hooks will format and fix them for you on committing.
