# Configure Vite

Slidev is powered by [Vite](http://vitejs.dev/) under the hood. This means you can leverage Vite's great plugin system to customize your slides even further.

The `vite.config.ts` will be respected if you have one.

Slidev has the following plugins preconfigured:

- [@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue)
- [vite-plugin-md](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-md)
- [vite-plugin-components](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-components)
- [vite-plugin-windicss](https://github.com/windicss/vite-plugin-windicss)
- [vite-plugin-icons](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-icons)
- [vite-plugin-remote-assets](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-remote-assets)
