# Customizations

Slidev is fully customizable, from styling to tooling configurations. It allows you to configure the tools underneath ([Vite](/custom/config-vite), [Windi CSS](/custom/config-windicss), [Monaco](/custom/config-monaco), etc.)

## Frontmatter Configures

You can configure Slidev in the frontmatter of your first slide, the following shows the default value for each option.

```yaml
---
# theme id or package name
theme: 'default'
# title of your slide, will auto infer from the first header if not specified
title: ''
# enabled pdf downloading in SPA build, can also be a custom url
download: true
# syntax highlighter, can be 'prism' or 'shiki'
highlighter: 'prism'
# enable monaco editor, default to dev only
monaco: 'dev'
---
```
