Whenever you want to do some modification in the presentation, simply add `{monaco}` after the language id â€” it turns the block into a fully-featured Monaco editor!

````md
```ts {monaco}
console.log('HelloWorld')
```
````

## Diff Editor

Monaco can also generate a diff between two code blocks. Use `{monaco-diff}` to turn the block into a [Monaco diff editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html?source=v0.36.1#example-creating-the-diffeditor-multi-line-example) and use `~~~` to separate the original and modified code!

````md
```ts {monaco-diff}
console.log('Original text')
~~~
console.log('Modified text')
```
````
