# Click Markers

For some slides you might have longer notes that could be hard to find your place. Slidev supports click markers that allow highlighting and auto-scrolling to the section of notes from your corresponding content. Put `[click]` markers in your notes for the timing you need to go to another [click](/guide/animations#click-animation), Slidev divides the content between the click markers and highlights it in presenter notes, synchronized with your slide progress.
