# Editor Support

Since Slidev is using Markdown as the source entry, you can use ANY editors you love to write it.

If you want some high-level management to your slides, we have provided the following editor integrations for you!

## Integrated Editor

Slidev comes with an integrated [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor that will instantly reload and save the changes to your file.

Click the <carbon-edit class="inline-icon-btn"/> button to open it.
