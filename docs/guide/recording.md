# Recording

Slidev has a built-in recording feature, as well as a camera view. You can use them to record your presentation easily in one simple tool rather than juggling a bunch of disparate recording options while also giving a talk.

## Camera View

Click the <carbon-user-avatar class="inline-icon-btn"/> button in the navigation panel to show your camera view in the presentation. You can drag to move it, and use the handler on the right bottom corner to resize it. The size and position will persist in `localStorage` and will therefore be consistent across multiple refreshes, so no need to worry about that.

## Recording

Clicking the <carbon-video class="inline-icon-btn"/> button in the navigation panel will bring up a dialog for you. Here you can choose to either record your camera output embedded in your slides or to separate them into two video files.

This feature is powered by [RecordRTC](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC) and uses the [WebRTC API](https://webrtc.org/).
