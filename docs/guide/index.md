# Getting Started

Slidev <sup>(slide + dev, **/slaɪdɪv/**)</sup> is a web-based slides maker and presenter. It's designed for developers to focus on writing content in Markdown while also having the power of HTML and Vue components to deliver pixel-perfect layouts and designs with embedded interactive demos in your presentations.

It uses a feature-rich markdown file to generate beautiful slides with an instant reloading experience, along with many built-in integrations such as live coding, PDF exporting, presentation recording, and so on. Since it's powered by the web, you can do anything with Slidev - the possibilities are endless.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Slidev](/guide/why) section.

Follow the prompts and start making your slides now! For more details about the markdown syntax, read through the [syntax guide](/guide/syntax).

## Command Line Interface

In a project where Slidev is installed, you can use the `slidev` binary in your npm scripts.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "slidev", // start dev server
    "build": "slidev build", // build for production SPA
    "export": "slidev export" // export slides to pdf
  }
}
```

Otherwise, you can use it with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

```bash
$ npx slidev
```

Run `slidev --help` for more options available.

## Markdown Syntax

Slidev reads your `slides.md` file under your project root and converts them into slides. Whenever you make changes to it, the content of the slides will be updated immediately. For example:

````md
# Slidev

Hello World

---

# Page 2

Directly use code blocks for highlighting

```ts
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

---

# Page 3
````

Read more about the Slidev Markdown syntax in the [syntax guide](/guide/syntax).
