## Create Slides

### Try it Online

Start Slidev right in your browser with StackBlitz: [sli.dev/new](https://sli.dev/new)

### Create Locally

> Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 18.0 installed.

Run the following command to create a new Slidev project locally:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm init slidev@latest
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create slidev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create slidev
```

:::

Follow the prompts to start your slides project. The slides content is in `slides.md`, which initially includes demos of most the Slidev features. For more information about the Markdown syntax, please check <LinkInline link="guide/syntax" />.

:::: details Single file usage (not recommended)

If you prefer to have a single Markdown file as your slides, you can install the Slidev CLI globally:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i -g @slidev/cli
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i -g @slidev/cli
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn global add @slidev/cli
```

:::

Then, you can create and start a single file slides via:

```bash
slidev slides.md
```

## Basic Commands

Slidev provides a set of commands in its CLI. Here are some common ones:

- `slidev` - Start the dev server. See [the dev command](../builtin/cli#dev).
- `slidev export` - Export the slides to PDF, PPTX, or PNGs. See <LinkInline link="guide/exporting" />.
- `slidev build` - Build the slides as a static web application. See <LinkInline link="guide/hosting" />.
- `slidev format` - Format the slides. See [the format command](../builtin/cli#format).
- `slidev --help` - Show the help message

To run these commands, you can add them to your `package.json` scripts (which has been done for you if the project was created via `npm init slidev`):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "slidev --open",
    "build": "slidev build",
    "export": "slidev export"
  }
}
```

Then, you can simply run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, and `npm run export`.

For more information about the CLI, please check the [CLI guide](../builtin/cli).
