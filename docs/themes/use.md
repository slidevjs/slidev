# Use Theme

Change the theme in Slidev is surprisingly easy. All you need to do is to add the `theme:` field in your frontmatter.

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

You can either directly start the server and it will show up the prompt to install the theme automatically for you

<div class="language-md">
<pre>
<span class="token keyword">?</span> Does not found theme <span class="token string">"@slidev/theme-seriph"</span> in your project, do you want to install it now? â€º (Y/n)
</pre>
</div>

or you can install the theme manually via

```bash
$ npm install @slidev/theme-seriph
```

And that's all, enjoy the new theme! For more details about the usage, you can refer to the theme's README.
